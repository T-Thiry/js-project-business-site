      <p>"The best thing about this workshop? It was pure, hands-on learning üõ†Ô∏è. We built
        prototypes, tested ideas, and got real-time feedback from both peers and mentors. It felt like I learned a lot

      <p>"I showed up with zero expectations and left with a dozen new connections, and new friends. The energy in the
        room was unreal‚Äîeveryone was brainstorming, coding, and
        debugging like their lives depended on it. It was stressful, chaotic, and honestly?."üöÄ</p>

      <p>"I signed up for a UX design workshop to learn a few tricks, and left questioning every
        design decision I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. The hands-on exercises were fantastic, and the instructor gave us
        challenges that forced us to think outside the box."üé® </p>
