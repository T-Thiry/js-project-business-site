          hilarious tangents.üòÇ Somehow, we managed to take all of our wild ideas and shape them into something
          actionable and creative. If every meeting was this engaging, I‚Äôd never complain about them again!"</p>

          prototypes, tested ideas, and got real-time feedback from both peers and mentors. It felt like I learned more
          in one day than in an entire semester of online courses. If you love learning by doing, this is the way to
          go!"</p>

          debugging like their lives depended on it. It was stressful, chaotic, and honestly? The most fun I‚Äôve had in
          years."üöÄ</p>

          design decision I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. The hands-on exercises were fantastic, and the instructor gave us
          real-world challenges that forced us to think outside the box. Now I can‚Äôt even look at a badly designed
          website without mentally fixing it."üé® </p>
